In this project, MPNet—a motion planning network, the technique employed by [Qureshi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05767)
is used. This network receives environment information as point-clouds, as well as the robot’s initial and
desired goal configurations and recursively calls itself to bidirectionally generate connectable
paths. MPNet is implemented using Tensorflow, an end-to-end open-source machine learning
platform with Python.
