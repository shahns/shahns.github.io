As a part of master thesis project, a stereocamera system was designed which is able to reconstuct objects with sub-millimetre depth resolution. Concept of positive and negative pattern projection by means of optical projector is evaluated provide robustness to specular reflection. As a consequence of wide baseline, DAISY desriptors is calculated.
